## Get support

We provide support through the [GGUS](https://ggus.eu/) portal,
operated by [EGI](http://www.egi.eu/).

## Issue trackers

Developments and issues used to be tracked in the [INFN JIRA issue tracking service][voms-jira], but now they are tracked in the corresponding GitHub projects:

- [VOMS Java Clients](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms-clients/issues)
- [VOMS Java APIs](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms-api-java/issues)
- [VOMS Core (Server, C/C++ APIs and Clients)](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms/issues)
- [VOMS MySQL Plugin](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms-mysql-plugin/issues)
- [VOMS Admin Server](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms-admin-server/issues)
- [VOMS Admin Client](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms-admin-client/issues)

Note that the VOMS-Admin Server and Client are not actively developed anymore and there is very minimal support for them until the end of 2024.
