---

Today we announce a new release for several VOMS components fixing outstanding
bugs and providing new features. Updates are released and supported for the foreseeable future for the RedHat 9 platform.
Knowing that this release fixes a vulnerability, we decided to provided rpms also for RedHat 8 and CentOS 7.

The updated components are:

- [VOMS Core (Server, C/C++ APIs and Clients)]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/voms-core/2.1.0)
- [VOMS clients 3.3.3]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/voms-clients/3.3.3)
- [VOMS Java APIs 3.3.3]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/voms-api-java/3.3.3)
- [VOMS Admin server 3.9.0]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/voms-admin-server/3.9.0)


> Note: Even if it has been declared in EOL, we provided an update for VOMS Admin server just to help all the communities those have not yet migrated. We won't provide any other upgrade in the foresseable future

Components those have been just repackaged for new platforms:

- [VOMS MySQL plugin 3.1.7-2]({{site.baseurl}}/release-notes/voms-mysql-plugin/3.1.7-2)


Not ported to RedHat 8/9 components:

- VOMS Admin client
- VOMS MySQL metapackage
